<h1>JWT (json web token)</h1>
<br>
Visit <a href="https://jwt.io" target="_blank">JWT</a> for more info. JWT is a safe way to represent claims between two
parties. The shape of jwt is header.payload.signature (xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz).
<br>
header contains two parts: (1) type of token (which is JWT) (2) signing algorithm (such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA)
<br>
payload conains claims (iss(issuer), exp(expiration time), sub(subject), aud(audience) and others). There are public and
private claims. The payload is Base64Url encoded.
<br>
signature is used for verification purpose. To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the
encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. The signature is used to verify the
message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the
sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

<strong>How do JSON Web Tokens work?</strong>
<br>
In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since
tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens
longer than required.
<br>
<br>
You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security.
<br>
<br>
Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the
Authorization header using the Bearer schema. This can be, in certain cases, a stateless authorization mechanism. The
server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be
allowed to access protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for
certain operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case. If the token is sent in the Authorization
header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.
<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the
    different authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application will go through the
    /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.</li>
  <li>When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.</li>
  <li>The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
Do note that with signed tokens, all the information contained within the token is exposed to users or other parties,
even though they are unable to change it. This means you should not put secret information within the token.
